# Quadcopter
The purpose of this project was to build a drone capable of aiding in a natural disaster. If an earthquake were to happen, then first responders would need to be able to see the wreckage from many different vantage points quickly. This means that they would need something capable of being in the air and also capable of showing them what it sees. The quadcopter that I envisioned is able to quickly rise to large heights, stream the video it is seeing to a local computer via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, and is also able to automatically stabilize in the air. In order to do this I am going to use an Arduino mega that will be hooked up to multiple sensors (MPU6050) and a camera (Adafruit TTL with SD card). The end goal of this project would be to have a quadcopter that is able to sustain consistently stable flight.
